📊 **Restaurant Performance & Customer Insights Dashboard**

**Power BI Capstone Project**

**1. Project Overview**

This project focuses on analysing restaurant performance and customer preferences using interactive Power BI dashboards. The goal is to transform raw restaurant and customer rating data into meaningful insights that support data-driven business decisions for restaurant operators and stakeholders.

**2. Business Problem**

Restaurant businesses often struggle to identify which cuisines, locations, and restaurant types perform best in terms of customer satisfaction. Without proper analysis, decision-making related to menu planning, location strategy, and operational improvements becomes inefficient.

**3. Project Objectives**
  - Analyse customer ratings and satisfaction levels
  - Identify popular cuisines and high-performing restaurants
  - Explore location-based performance patterns
  - Present insights through a clear and interactive Power BI dashboard

**4. Dataset** 
  - Source: ChefMoz & GeoPlaces datasets
  - Data Type: Restaurant details, cuisine types, customer ratings, and geographic information
  - Purpose: To evaluate restaurant performance and customer preferences across different locations and cuisines

**5. Data Preparation & Modelling**
  - The dataset was prepared and modelled using Power BI to ensure accuracy and usability:
  - Data cleaning and transformation using Power Query
  - Removal of duplicates and handling missing values
  - Creation of relationships between restaurant, cuisine, and location tables
  - Development of basic calculated measures to support analysis
  - This process ensured reliable data for meaningful visualisation and insights.

**6. Dashboard Structure**
The Power BI report is organised into three main pages:

📌 **Page 1: Overview**

Provides a high-level summary of restaurant performance, including:

- Total number of restaurants
- Average customer rating
- Geographic distribution by state
- Most popular cuisine types and price ranges

📌 **Page 2: Customer Satisfaction**

Focuses on customer behaviour and satisfaction drivers:

- Customer demographics and visitor groups
- Food and service ratings
- Impact of payment method, parking, and ambience on ratings

📌 **Page 3: Operational Insights**

Analyses operational patterns and efficiency:

- Operating hours and duration
- Customer ratings based on operating hours
- Comparison of operational performance by state

📌 **Page 4: Cuisine Performance**

Highlights cuisine-level performance and trends:

- Top cuisines by number of restaurants
- Cuisine ratings by state
- Relationship between cuisine type, pricing, and customer ratings

**7. Key Insights**
  - Certain cuisine types consistently receive higher average customer ratings, indicating strong customer preference.
  - Customer satisfaction varies across locations, suggesting that geographic factors may influence restaurant performance.
  - A small group of restaurants outperforms others significantly, highlighting potential best practices.
  - Some cuisines and locations show lower ratings, indicating opportunities for operational or service improvements.

**8. Tools & Skills Demonstrated**
  - Power BI – dashboard development and interactive visualisation
  - Power Query – data cleaning and transformation
  - Data Modelling – building relationships between multiple datasets
  - Business Analytics – translating data into actionable insights

**9. Outcome & Learning**
This project strengthened my ability to:

  - Perform end-to-end data analysis from raw data to insights
  - Design dashboards with a clear business focus
  - Communicate analytical findings in a structured and meaningful way
